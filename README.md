# Unified-Mentor-Internship-Project-1-forest_cover_prediction

##  Objective
 Build a system that can predict the type of forest cover using analysis data for a 30m x 30m
 patch of land in the forest
 
## Dataset
 This dataset is an analysis dataset from the forest department performed in the Roosevelt
 National Forest of northern Colorado.<br>
 Integer Classification of the forest cover types:<br>
 ● 1-Spruce/Fir<br>
 ● 2-Lodgepole Pine<br>
 ● 3-Ponderosa Pine<br>
 ● 4-Cottonwood/Willow<br>
 ● 5-Aspen<br>
 ● 6-Douglas-fir<br>
 ● 7-Krummholz<br>
 
## Description of main columns:
 ● Elevation- Elevation in meters<br>
 ● Aspect- Aspect in degrees azimuth<br>
 ● Slope- Slope in degrees<br>
 ● Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology- Horz Dist to nearest surface water features<br>
 ● Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology- Vert Dist to nearest surface water features<br>
 ● Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways- Horz Dist to nearest roadway<br>
 ● Hillshade_9am (0 to 255 index)- Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice<br>
 ● Hillshade_Noon (0 to 255 index)- Hillshade index at noon, summer solstice<br>
 ● Hillshade_3pm (0 to 255 index)- Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice<br>
 ● Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points- Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points<br>
 ● Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence)- Wilderness area
 designation.<br>
 ● Soil_Type (40 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence)- Soil Type designation<br>
 ● Cover_Type- Forest Cover Type designation.
